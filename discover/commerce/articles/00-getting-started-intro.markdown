# Getting Started with @commerce@ [](id=getting-started)

@commerce@ is a digital commerce platform for midmarket enterprises. While
highly customizable, it is not merely a collection of tools for hacking together
your own custom commerce system (though it could certainly be used for that).
@commerce@ is a full-service commerce solution that offers out-of-the-box
functionality.

@commerce@ is built on top of @product@, and as such is integrated with
@product@'s content and user management systems. Any website built with
@product-ver@ can be integrated seamlessly with a store built with @commerce@.

Supports physical and digital products, supports multiple currencies.
A full-service commerce solution.




@commerce@: is equipped with a 
[catalog management](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/catalog-management)
system that supports both physical and virtual products. The catalog stores
a wide range of product data---product variations, pricing, images,
specifications---and makes it readily available to the store's customer-facing
pages.

Those customer-facing pages can be constructed with the methods that have
already been proven by long-time users of @product@. Setting up
a 
[storefront](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/setting-up-a-storefront)
is facilitated by a wide range of new tools that @commerce@ provides
specifically for the purpose. New search tools, for instance, are geared
specifically for surfing the contents of the catalog, while customizable widgets
make it easy to add common UI elements---such as *Checkout* and *View Cart*---to
a page.

@commerce@ is optimized for business-to-business transactions, with an eye
toward making B2B more user-friendly than it sometimes tends to be. 
[Customer Portal](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/customer-portal)
is designed to serve the needs of buyers who have an approval process to observe
before making purchases. When a buyer places an order, @commerce@ can send an
automated email to his manager (or managers), prompting her to approve the order
to that it can be processed. The customer portal gives the buyers the ability to
manage their own accounts, allowing them to designate their own buyers, order
managers, and account managers.

@commerce@ features a user control system that is integrated with @product@'s
roles and permissions functionality. 
[User segmentation](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/user-segmentation)
allows pricing, catalog visibility, and other features to be precisely targeted
to certain customers.

Once you have installed @commerce@ from
[Marketplace](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-liferay-marketplace),
the app's features are enabled and ready to go.

Most of @commerce@'s features can be found in the Commerce Menu, and if what you
want is to start setting up a web store from scratch, then that's exactly where
you should go. But many users--especially new users--will find it easier to
start off by deploying a starter kit instead.

A starter kit is simply a site template that includes the backbone of what
a functioning web store needs: a catalog populated with sample items, product
display pages, a working checkout procedure, etc.

To activate a starter kit, go to the control panel and create a new site. When
prompted to choose a site template (for more information, see 
[site templates]( /discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/building-sites-from-templates))
select one of the commerce templates.

![Figure 1: *Customer Portal* and *Lotus* are both commerce templates.](../images/starter-kits.png)

At the time of this writing, there are two commerce templates. *Customer Portal*
models a typical B2B use case, while *Lotus* is a B2C retailer.

Now we're moving. The next section covers the most important aspect of any
store: the catalog and the products it holds.

<!--Starter kits need to go into separate document. This section should mainly be an overview of commerce features. Starter kits should only be touched on, and don't call them starter kits. They're site templates now.

For commerce features, use the top-level categories in the outline. Roughly; "settings" isn't a feature. For material, look to the introductions that you've already written to each section.
