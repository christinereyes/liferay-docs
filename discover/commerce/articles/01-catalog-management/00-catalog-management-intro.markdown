# Catalog Management [](id=catalog-management)

The @commerce@ catalog is at the heart of any store site, storing and organizing
its core content. It consists of a list of the products the store offers, along
with the information and relations necessary to organize and display them. The
catalog tracks not only what items are for sale, but also inventory levels,
product variants, and category assignments. It also organizes files related to
its products, such as images and user manuals, and contains pricing information.

To view the catalog, go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog*. Its
contents are displayed under the *Products* tab.
