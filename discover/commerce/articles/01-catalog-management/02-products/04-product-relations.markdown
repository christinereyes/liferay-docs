# Product Relations [](id=product-relations)

When a customer browses your web store, it makes sense to advertise products
related to the specific item he or she is looking for. Often the advertised item
is something most customers would buy anyway--a mouse to go with that new
laptop, for example--but which they might buy from another vendor if they aren't
aware of the breadth of your catalog.

To create a product relation, click on the product in the catalog and then go to
the *Product Relations* tab. Click on the *Add* button and select whichever
items you wish to add links to on the product's display page.

![Figure 1: The row of tabs at the left allows you to create multiple sets of related products.](../../../images/product-relations.png)

To the left of the screen, a number of product relation types are displayed:
up-sell, cross-sell, accessories, etc. New product relations can be added in
each tab. This allows for the creation of several different sets of product
relations which can be easily alternated by configuring the Search Results
portlet on the [product display page](discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/product-detail-page).

<!--Ok. To create your own type, go into Control panel/system
settings/category.commerce/Product relation types. Add as many types as you want
and call them what you want-they all work the same way. To determine which type
will be displayed, configure the search results portal on the product detail
page. Not sure yet whether this can be customized by individual product or if
you have to have individual pages to do that.-->
