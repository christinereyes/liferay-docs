# Discounts

A discount applies a modifier to a product's base price. It can be expressed as
either an absolute number or a percentage, applied to either a limited number of
products or to the entire catalog, and available either to all buyers or to
a defined user segment. Unlike a price list, a discount always reduces the base
price and never increases it.

## Creating a Discount

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Discounts* and click on the
    ![Add](../images/icon-add.png) button at the top right. This displays the
    *Add Discount* form.

2.  In the *Title* field, give your discount a name.
