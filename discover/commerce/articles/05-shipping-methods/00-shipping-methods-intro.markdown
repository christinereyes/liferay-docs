# Shipping Methods [](id=shipping-methods)

When a buyer places an order, she should be prompted to choose among a variety
of shipping methods. You can create as many shipping methods as you like, but
they come in just three general types:

**Flat Rate** shipping applies the same price to every product in the catalog.

**Variable Rate** shipping allows you to set up a formula to calculate a unique
rate for each order, on the basis of weight, product price, or other factors.

**Carrier** shipping allows you align your shipping processes closely with
those of a particular shipping company. This can help ensure that the prices you
charge your customers closely match your actual shipping costs.

You can create any number of methods for each type, but remember that every
shipping method you create will be available to ship every product in the
catalog.
