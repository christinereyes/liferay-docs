# Accounts Management [](id=accounts-management)

The Beryl Customer Portal's distinguishing feature is its account management
system. In a B2C scenario, product selection, order placement, and payment are
all handled by the consumer. B2B transactions, however, often have more complex
requirements: one employee might select products to buy, another might approve
that selection, and yet another might handle payment. With Customer Portal, you
can set up accounts which can be accessed by these users with different roles.

Roles can be customized any way you want. By default, however, the customer
portal uses three roles for customer users: Buyers, Order Managers, and Account
Managers.

**Buyers** are customer users who select what products to buy. By default,
buyers can view and checkout orders.

**Order Managers** are customer users who oversee the purchasing process. In
addition to the permissions that a buyer has, the can delete, manage, and
approve orders.

**Account Managers** are customer users who oversee the account. They can assign
roles to users and determine which users have access to the account.

Keep in mind, however, that all three of these roles are meant to be occupied by
*customers*. The seller's site administrators still retain ultimate control over
accounts management.
