# Setting up a Storefront [](id=setting-up-a-storefront)

Once the catalog is populated, you need a way to display its contents to buyers,
as well as an interface that allows them to place orders. If you choose not to
use a site initializer such as Beryl, you'll need to set this up manually, but
it's a straightforward process.

Here are the components you may need:

- Product landing pages

- Product category landing pages

- A shopping cart

- A checkout page

- A search page

- A compare products page

The product and product category landing pages are described in 
[Displaying Product Pages](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/displaying-product-pages)
and [Displaying Category
Pages](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/displaying-category-pages).

## Shopping Cart

The product detail widget (see 
[Displaying Product Pages](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/displaying-product-pages))
gives users a way to add products to the cart, but it does not make the cart
visible. A cart widget is necessary to view or edit its content directly.

There are three separate cart widgets, each with its own uses. They can be found
at the *Add Menu* &rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Commerce*.

The *Commerce Cart Content* widget displays the cart's current contents. It
includes controls to change the quantity of the products it holds, as well as to
delete them entirely.

The *Commerce Cart Content Total* widget displays the total price of all items
in the cart, and includes a button to check out. It does not list the cart's
contents.

The *Commerce Cart Content Mini* displays the cart's contents and includes
a button to check out but no controls to edit its content. Instead, it displays
an *Edit Cart* button which links to the *Commerce Cart Content* widget. Because
of this link, the Content Mini widget will not function unless your site
includes a page with a Cart Content widget on it.

Follow these steps to set up a cart for a typical use case:

1.  [Create a page](/discover/portal/-knowledge_base/7-1/creating-and-managing-pages).

2.  Go to *Add Menu* &rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Commerce* and add *Commerce
    Cart Content* and *Commerce Cart Content Total* widgets to the page. This
    is your main shopping cart page.

3.  On other suitable pages, such as product and category pages, add the more
    compact *Commerce Cart Content Mini*, which provides quick reference to the
    cart as well as a link to the main cart page.

## Checkout

The purchase process is handled by a *Commerce Checkout* widget. Follow
these steps.

1.  [Create a page](/discover/portal/-knowledge_base/7-1/creating-and-managing-pages).

2.  Go to the *Add Menu* &rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Commerce* and add a *Commerce
    Checkout* Widget to the page.

Without any further configuration, the *Checkout* widget features a four-step
process: users are first prompted to enter a shipping address, then a billing
address, then an order summary, and finally an order confirmation. When you
configure [Shipping
Methods](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/shipping-methods)
and [Payment
Methods](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/payment-methods),
addition steps are automatically added the checkout portlet's process, prompting
users to select one of each.

## Search

The commerce *Search Results* widget allows buyers to find the products they
want. There are two ways to populate search results with products: by clicking
on a link in a *Commerce Category Navigation* widget, or by entering search
terms in a *Search Bar* widget.

**Note:** the commerce search results widget (found in *Add Menu* &rarr;
*Widgets* &rarr; *Commerce*) is not the same as the regular search results
widget (in *Add Menu* &rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Search*). The regular widget
searches all kinds of indexed material---web content, blogs, documents,
etc.---while the commerce version only searches products in the catalog.

### Category Navigation

Category navigation always searches by category. When a user clicks on
a link in the navigation widget, the appropriate category page is displayed. If
there is a search results portlet on that page, it will show the products
assigned to that category. See [Displaying Category
Pages](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/displaying-category-pages)
for details.

### The Search Bar

A search bar, in contrast, allows users to search using whatever terms they
want and displays appropriate products in the results widget. See 
[Configuring
Search](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/configuring-search-pages) for
details on how to set up the search bar. Keep in mind that those instructions
assume the use of the standard search results widget. To search the catalog for
products, you must use the commerce search results widget instead, but the
process is otherwise the same.

### Search Facets

Regardless of whether users are clicking on links to categories or typing
keywords into a search bar, they will need a way to filter their results. Search
facet widgets make this possible.

The two facet widgets designed specifically to filter the catalog are
*Specification Option Facets* and *Option Facets*, both of which can be found in
*Add Menu* &rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Commerce*. Simply place either widget onto
a page that also contains a search results portlet to filter results by
[specification](/web/liferay-emporio/documentations/-/knowledge_base/7-1/specifications)
or [option](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/7-1/options),
respectively.

## Compare Products

The product comparison feature allows users to display details of multiple
products on a single page. Follow these steps to enable this feature.

1.  [Create a page](/discover/portal/-knowledge_base/7-1/creating-and-managing-pages).

2.  Go to *Add Menu* &rarr; *Widgets* &rarr; *Commerce* and add a *Compare
    Products* widget to the page.

3.  Go to your 
    [product page](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/displaying-product-pages) 
    and add a *Compare Products Mini* widget to the page.

When a user clicks on the *Compare* box in the *Product Detail* widget, the
product will be saved to compare and displayed in the *Compare Products Mini*
widget. When a users clicks on the *Compare* button in the mini widget, then the
page with the *Compare Products* widget is displayed, showing all of the
products that have been selected for comparison.
