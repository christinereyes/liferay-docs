## Availability Estimates

When an item is out of stock, you need communicate to buyers when it will be
available again. By entering an availability estimate, you can provide that
information just by selecting a time frame from a drop-down menu.

Follow these steps to create an availability estimate:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings* and click on the
    *Availability Estimates* tab. Click on the ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)
    button at the top right.

2.  Enter the estimate in the *Title* field. For example, "2-3 weeks," or "4-6
    days."

    Enter a priority to establish the order in which estimates will appear in
    the drop-down. Lowest numbers come first.

3.  Click *Save*. Repeat steps 1-3 if you need to create different estimates for
    different products.

To apply an availability estimate to a product, go to the product's
*Configuration* tab and make a selection from the *Availability Estimate*
drop-down. See
[Configuration](web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-knowledge_base/7_1/configuration#inventory)
for more information. The estimate will be displayed automatically whenever the
product is out of stock.

## Countries

Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings* and click on the
*Countries* tab to view the countries in the system. The countries on this list
are available to choose from anywhere a user is prompted to enter a country
(typically to enter a shipping or billing address). On this page you can edit
the countries in this list, or---if geopolitical events warrant---add or delete
them.

You can also determine to which countries you will permit billing and shipping.
Follow these steps:

1.  To edit a country, click on its name, or else on
    ![Options](../../images/icon-options) &rarr; *Edit*.

2.  Check or uncheck the *Billing Allowed* and *Shipping Allowed* boxes.

3.  Click *Save*.

When editing a country you can also change its identifying information (name,
ISO codes), determine whether billing and shipping to that country will be
permitted, and select a priority (priority determines where in a menu a country
will be located. Lowest numbers come first). You can also deactivate a country
by unchecking the *Active* box. This removes the country from all menus in the
site where it could otherwise be selected.

### Regions

You can add regions to countries to allow users to make a selection from a menu
when entering an address. By default, regions are already in place for the USA
and for Italy. Follow these steps:

1.  Click on a country's name and then on the *Regions* sub-tab.

2.  Click on the ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button, enter a name, an ISO
    code, and priority.

3.  Check the *Active* box and hit *Save*.

## Currencies

Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings* and click on the
*Currencies* tab to view the currencies in the system.

To choose your store's primary currency, click on the
![Options](../../images/icon-options.png) button &rarr; Set as Primary.

To add a new currency, follow these steps:

1.  Click on the ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button and fill in the *Add
    Currency* form.

    **Name:** Enter the currency's name.

    **Code:** Enter the currency's ISO code.

    **Format Pattern:** Enter the currency's sign, the number digits to come
    between commas, and the number decimal places. For example, for US dollars,
