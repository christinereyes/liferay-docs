# Availability Estimates

When an item is out of stock, you need communicate to buyers when it will be
available again. By entering an availability estimate, you can provide that
information just by selecting a time frame from a drop-down menu.

Follow these steps to create an availability estimate:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings* and click on the
    *Availability Estimates* tab. Click on the ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png)
    button at the top right.

2.  Enter the estimate in the *Title* field. For example, "2-3 weeks," or "4-6
    days."

    Enter a priority to establish the order in which estimates will appear in
    the drop-down. Lowest numbers come first.

3.  Click *Save*. Repeat steps 1-3 if you need to create different estimates for
    different products.

To apply an availability estimate to a product, go to the product's
*Configuration* tab and make a selection from the *Availability Estimate*
drop-down. See
[Configuration](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1_0/configuration#inventory)
for more information. The estimate will be displayed automatically whenever the
product is out of stock.
