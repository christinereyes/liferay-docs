# Countries

@commerce@ stores a list of countries that is available to choose from anywhere
a user is prompted to enter a country (typically to enter a shipping or billing
address). Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings* and click on the
*Countries* tab to view the countries in the system. On this page you can edit
the countries in this list, or---if geopolitical events warrant---add or delete
them.

You can also determine to which countries you will permit billing and shipping.
Follow these steps:

1.  To edit a country, click on its name, or else on
    ![Options](../../images/icon-options) &rarr; *Edit*.

2.  Check or uncheck the *Billing Allowed* and *Shipping Allowed* boxes.

3.  Click *Save*.

When editing a country you can also change its identifying information (name,
ISO codes), determine whether billing and shipping to that country will be
permitted, and select a priority (priority determines where in a menu a country
will be located. Lowest numbers come first). You can also deactivate a country
by unchecking the *Active* box. This removes the country from all menus in the
site where it could otherwise be selected.

## Regions

You can add regions to countries to allow users to make a selection from a menu
when entering an address. By default, regions are already in place for the USA
and for Italy. Follow these steps to add a new region:

1.  Click on a country's name and then on the *Regions* sub-tab.

2.  Click on the ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button, enter a name, an ISO
    code, and priority.

3.  Check the *Active* box and hit *Save*.
