# Notifications

Notifications provide a way for you to send automated emails to buyers. By
default, notifications can only be sent to inform buyers when an order has been
received, but an extension point allows for the development of other uses:
custom notifications might be triggered by an order being shipped, a product
being restocked, or any other event.

Using notifications involves setting up a *Notification Template*, which defines
the notification's sender, its trigger, and its content.

Follow these steps to set up a notification to be sent when an order is
received:

1.  Go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Settings*. Click on the
    *Notifications* tab and then the *Notification Template* sub-tab.

2.  Click on the ![Add](../../images/icon-add.png) button and fill in the *Add
    Notification Template Form*.

    **Name:** Give the template a name.

    **User Segments:** Click **Select** and choose segments from the list to
    determine which users will receive notifications. If no segment is selected,
    then all users will receive notifications. See 
    [User Segments](/web/liferay-emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/1-0/user-segments)
    for more detail.

    **From Address:** Enter the email address that will appear in the
    notification's *from* field.

    **From Name:** Enter a name to accompany the address.

    **Type:** Select *Order Placed* from the drop-down. This sets the
    notification to be sent to a user after he places an order. It is the only
    notification trigger available by default.

    **Body:** Enter the actual text of the message. You can include the name of
    the user who placed the order and the order number by including the text
    [%ORDER_CREATOR%] or [%ORDER_ID%] (including brackets) in the message.

    Notifications will not be sent unless the *Enabled* box is checked. You can
    also add a description (for internal use), and addresses to CC or BCC. Click
    *Save*.

Once the template is created, a new notification will be added to the
notification queue whenever an order is placed. You can view the queue by
clicking on the *Notification Queue* sub-tab in the *Notifications* tab. At
specified intervals---the default is every 15 minutes---@commerce@ will check
the queue and send any unsent notifications.

To set the interval at which @commerce@ checks the queue, follow these steps:

1.  Go to *Control Menu* &rarr; *Configuration* &rarr; *System Settings*. In the
    *Commerce* section, click on the *Orders* link and then on the *Commerce
    Notification Queue* tab.

2.  In the *Notification Queue Entry Check Interval* field, enter the desired
    interval in minutes.

3.  Click Save.
