# Getting Started

Once you have installed @commerce@ from
[Marketplace](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-1/using-the-liferay-marketplace),
the app's features are enabled and ready to go.

![Figure 1: You can get started immediately by accessing features in *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce*--but that option might not be the best
one for you.](../../images/sitemenu-commerce.png)

Most of @commerce@'s features can be found in the Commerce Menu, and if what you
want is to start setting up a web store from scratch, then that's exactly where
you should go. But many users--especially new users--will find it easier to
start off by deploying a starter kit instead.

A starter kit is simply a site template that includes the backbone of what
a functioning web store needs: a catalog populated with sample items, product
display pages, a working checkout procedure, etc.

To activate a starter kit, go to the control panel and create a new site. When
prompted to choose a site template (for more information, see 
[site templates]( /discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7-0/building-sites-from-templates))
select one of the commerce templates.

![Figure 2: *Customer Portal* and *Lotus* are both commerce templates.](../../images/starter-kits.png)

At the time of this writing, there are two commerce templates. *Customer Portal*
models a typical B2B use case, while *Lotus* is a B2C retailer.

Now we're moving. The next section covers the most important aspect of any
store: the catalog and the products it holds.
