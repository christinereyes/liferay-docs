# Images

A product image or video is a media file that has a relationship to a particular
product. This relationship can be used to ensure that the appropriate images are
displayed on product detail pages, in search results, or anywhere else
information about the product is displayed. Images can also be associated with
a specific product variant.

Follow these steps to create a product image:

1. Go to the product's page (*Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog* &rarr; select product),
   click on the *Images* tab and then the *Add* button in the upper-right to
   display the *Add Image* form. Click *Select File* to upload a new image or
   video, or to select one from the documents and media repository.

2. If you want to associate the image with a specific product variant, select
   one from the *Options* section of the *Add Image* form. This section
   contains a drop-down menu for each option template assigned to the product
   (see
   [options](/web/liferay/emporio/documentation/-/knowledge_base/7-1/options)
   for details on option templates and option values). Select an option value
   from the drop-down menu to associate the image with all of the product
   variants to which that value is assigned.If multiple option templates are
   active, you can select multiple values to associate the image only with that
   combination of options.

3. If you want the image to be displayed on the product page for a limited
   period of time, specify display and expiration dates in the *Schedule*
   section at the bottom of the form.
