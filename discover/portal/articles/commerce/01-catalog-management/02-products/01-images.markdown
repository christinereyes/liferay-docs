# Images

A product image or video is a media file that has a relationship with
a particular product. This relationship can be used to ensure
that the appropriate images are displayed on product detail pages, in search
results, or anywhere else information about the product is displayed. Images can
also be associated with a single product option or a combination of options.

Follow these steps to create a product image:

1. Go to the product's page (*Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog* &rarr; select product),
   click on the *Images* tab and then the *Add* button in the upper-right to
   display the *Add Image* form. Click *Select File* to upload a new image or
   video, or to select one from the documents and media repository.

2. If you want to associate the image with a specific option value, select one
   from the from the *Options* section of *Add Image* form, where there is
   a drop-down box for each option template the product deploys. If multiple
   option templates are active, you can select multiple values to associate the
   image only with that option combination.

3. If you want the image to be displayed on the product page for a limited
   period of time, specify display and expiration dates in the *Schedule*
   section at the bottom of the form.
