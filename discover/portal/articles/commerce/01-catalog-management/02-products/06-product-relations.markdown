# Product Relations

When a customer browses your web store, it makes sense to advertise products
related to the specific item he or she is looking for. Often the advertised item
is something most customers would buy anyway--a mouse to go with that new
laptop, for example--but which they might buy from another vendor if they aren't
aware of the breadth of your catalog.

To create a product relation, click on the product in the catalog and then go to
the *Product Relations* tab. Click on the *Add* button and select whichever
items you wish to add links to on your product's main page.

<!--Ok. To create your own type, go into Control panel/system
settings/category.commerce/Product relation types. Add as many types as you want
and call them what you want-they all work the same way. To determine which type
will be displayed, configure the search results portal on the product detail
page. Not sure yet whether this can be customized by individual product or if
you have to have individual pages to do that.-->

 ## Up-Selling

The *Up-selling* feature gives you an opportunity to notify your customers when
a more advanced, higher quality, or more up-to-date (and often more expensive)
product might better suit their needs than the one they are planning to buy.

<!--But how to I make it work?-->

## Cross selling

<!--I'm not sure how cross-selling is supposed to work either.-->
