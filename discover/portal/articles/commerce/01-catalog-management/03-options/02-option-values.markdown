# Option Values

Once an option template has been created, it may be necessary to assign option
values to it. Any option that asks buyers to choose from set of predefined
product variants requires option values.

There are two ways to create option values. Values created at the catalog scope
will be applied to all products that deploy the template. Values at the product
scope apply only to a single product and can override catalog-scoped values.

### Creating Option Values at the Catalog Scope

Follow these steps:

1.  Go to the catalog and select the *Option Templates* tab. Find the template
    you want to create values for and click on the *values* button next to its
    title.

2.  Click on the ![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png) button and fill in the
    following fields in the *Option Value Detail* form:

**Title:** Give the value a name.

**Priority:** Values will be displayed on a page in order of priority. Lower
numbers come first.

**Key:** A key is a unique identifier for referring to this value
programmatically. This field is filled automatically, so most users can safely
leave it alone.

3.  Click *Save*. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to create additional values.

### Creating Option Values at the Product Scope

Regardless of whether any catalog-scoped option values exist for a given option,
you can also create values that apply only to a single product. Follow these
steps:

1.  Go to the catalog and select the desired product. Click on the *Options*
    tab, find the template for which you want to create values and click on the
    *values* button next to its title.

    This displays a list of option values, including catalog-scoped values and
    any previously-created product-scoped values. These can be edited or
    deleted, if necessary, without impacting any other products. Just click on
    a value and make changes to the *Option Value Detail* form on the right.

3.  Click on the ![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png) button and fill in the
    *Option Value Detail* form as

    .

4.  Click *Save*. Repeat steps 3 and 4 to create additional values.
