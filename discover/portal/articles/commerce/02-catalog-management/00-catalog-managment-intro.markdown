# Catalog Management

The commerce catalog is at the heart of any web store, providing the store's
core content and organizing the metadata that will help create an engaging
shopping experience.

The catalog is simply a list of products offered by the web store, along with
data about those products that site administrators can use to organize and
display them. The catalog tracks not only what items are for sale, but also
inventory levels, product variants, and category assignments. It also organizes
files related to its products, such as images and user manuals, and contains
pricing information.

The following sections describe how to organize and populate your catalog.
