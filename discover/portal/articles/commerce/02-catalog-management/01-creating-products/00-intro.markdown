The contents of the catalog are displayed on the *Products* tab at *site menu*
&rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog*. Here you can search, sort, and filter the
catalog. You can also add products manually by clicking on the *Add* button
([Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) at the bottom of the screen and
then selecting the type of product you wish to create: simple, grouped or
virtual.

The following sections describe how to create and assign metadata to new
