# Images

Product images--in *Site Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog* &rarr; select
product &rarr; *Images* tab--are fairly straightforward. Click on the *Add*
button in the lower-right to display the *Add Image* form. Click *Select File*
to upload a new image or select one from the documents and media repository.
Setting the image's priority determines where it appears on the product page
(smaller numbers are displayed at the top).

If a product has multiple options, you may want to upload multiple images and
assign an option to each. Under the *Options* section of the *Add Images* form,
there is a drop down box for each option template the product deploys. Select
the option value with which you want to associate the image.

The *Options* section will be empty if the product does not deploy any option
templates as SKU contributors. Deploying option templates is covered in the next
section.

If you want the image to be displayed on the product page for a limited period
of time, specify display and expiration dates in the *Schedule* section at the
bottom of the form. By default, the image displays as soon as it is published
and is set to never expire.
