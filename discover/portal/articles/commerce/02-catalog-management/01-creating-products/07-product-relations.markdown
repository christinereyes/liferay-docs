### Product Relations

When a customer browses your web store, it makes sense to advertise products
related to the specific item he or she is looking for. Often the advertised item
is something most customers would buy anyway--a mouse to go with that new
laptop, for example--but which they might buy from another vendor if they aren't
aware of the breadth of your catalog.

To create a product relation, click on the product in the catalog and then go to
the *Product Relations* tab. Click on the *Add* button and select whichever
items you wish to add links to on your product's main page.

#### Up-Selling

#### Cross selling

<!--I'm not sure how either up-selling or cross-selling are intended to work-->
