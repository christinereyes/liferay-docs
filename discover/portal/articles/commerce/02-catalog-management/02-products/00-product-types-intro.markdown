# Product Types

The contents of the catalog are displayed on the *Products* tab at *Site Menu*
&rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog*. Here you can search, sort, and filter the
catalog. You can also add products manually by clicking on the *Add* button
(![Add](../../../../images/icon-add.png)) at the bottom of the screen and then
selecting the type of product you wish to create: simple, grouped or virtual.

## Simple Products

A simple product is...well...pretty simple. Just about any physical object--in
general, anything that can be bought from a brick-and-mortar store--can be
a simple product. When you create simple product, the standard product tab bar
is displayed, starting with a *Details* tab where you can edit entries from
the *Add Product* form.

## Grouped Products

Honestly, grouped products aren't much more complex than simple products.
A grouped product consists of two or more simple products from the catalog,
packaged together as a single item. This gives you the ability to set prices,
options, or terms for a set of products that differ from those for the same
products purchased separately.

When a grouped product has been created, an extra tab--*Grouped*--is displayed
in its product tab bar. From the *Grouped* tab, click on the *Add* button in the
lower-right to select any number of simple products. Once the simple products
have been added to the group, they can be edited individually
(![options](../../../../images/icon-options.png) &rarr; *Edit*) to set
a quantity and a priority (priority indicates the order in which items will be
displayed--lower numbers come first). Virtual products and other grouped
products cannot be added to the group.

## Virtual Products

A virtual product is any salable but non-physical item, such as extended
warranties, service contracts, digital subscriptions or almost anything else
that can be downloaded rather than shipped.

A virtual product also has an extra tab--fittingly, *Virtual*--in its product
tab bar. The *Virtual* tab contains the following fields:

**URL/Select File**: If your virtual product is stored at a web address, enter
the URL here. Alternatively, click *Select* to upload a local file or select
one that was uploaded previously.

**Activation Status**: Select the stage in the order process at which the
product becomes available for download.

**Duration**: Enter the number of days after purchase in which customers will
have access to the file. A value of 0 sets no limit.

**Max Usages**: Set the number of times a customer can download the file.
A value of 0 sets no limit.

**Sample**: Upload or enter a URL for a sample file that will be available to
prospective buyers. The *Use Sample* box must be checked before customers will
see the sample.

**Terms of Use**: Either enter a Terms of Use document directly into the
integrated editor, or select a document previously uploaded to Web Content.

The *Terms of Use* editor offers simple formatting options via the GUI, as well
as complete html functionality via the *Code View* button.

That's it for product types. The following sections cover the remaining items in
the product tab bar, starting with the basic information stored in the *Details*
tab.
