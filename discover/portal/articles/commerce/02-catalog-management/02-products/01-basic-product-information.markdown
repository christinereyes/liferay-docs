# Basic Product Information

Once you've selected the type of product you want to create, the *Add Product*
form is displayed. The form is the same for all product types and contains the
following fields:

**Title**: Name your product. This is the only required field.

**Short Description**: Text entered here will be displayed wherever the product
appears in a list or in thumbnail form. 

**Full Description**: This text is visible to customers on the product page. The
integrated text editor provides a number of formatting options that appear when
text is selected, and clicking on the *Add* button that appears when the editor
is in focus provides additional options. For more flexibility, click on the
*Code View* button on the right to edit the html directly.

**Friendly URL**: This is the URL for the product page. It auto-fills but can be
changed.

**Meta Title, Meta Keywords, Meta Description**: descriptors entered in these
fields will help search engines locate your products. 

**Schedule**: Products can be displayed to customers for a preset window of
time. If you don't want to bother with scheduling, make sure the *Never
Expire* box is checked. Unchecking the *Published* box will remove the product
from customers' view.

Once the *Add Product* form is complete to your satisfaction, click the
*Publish* button to add the product to the catalog. The product tab bar appears
at the top of the screen (and can be reached again at any time by navigating to
the catalog and selecting a product). The first tab, *Details*, is populated
with your responses from the *Add Product* form.

Now the product has been created, but your catalog needs more input before it
can really useful. The next sections cover that input, starting with product
images.
