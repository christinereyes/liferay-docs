# Basic Product Information

Once you've selected the type of product (see previous section) you want to
create, the *Add Product* form is displayed. The form is the same for all
product types and contains the following fields:

    -Title: the product's name. This is the only required field.

    -Short Description: Text entered here will be displayed whereever the
    product appears in a list or in thumbnail form. 

    -Full Description: This text is visible to customers on the product page.
    The integrated text editor provides a number of formatting options that
    appear when text is selected, and clicking on the *Add* button that appears
    when the editor is in focus provides additional options. For more
    flexibility, click on the *Code View* button on the right to edit the html
    directly.

    -Friendly URL: This is the URL for the product page. It auto-fills but
    can be changed.

    -Meta Title, Meta Keywords, Meta Description: descriptors entered in these
    fields will help search engines (Google, Bing) locate your products for
    consumers. 

    -Schedule: Products can displayed to customers for a preset window of time.
    If you don't want to bother with scheduling, make sure sure the *Never
    Expire* box is checked. Unchecking the *Published* box will remove the
    product from customers' view.

Once the *Add Product* form is complete to your satisfaction, click the
*Publish* button to add the product to the catalog. A new tab bar appears at the
top of the screen (the tab bar can be reached again at any time by navigating to
the catalog and selecting a product). The first tab, *Details*, is populated
with your responses from the *Add Product* form.

The remaining articles in this section cover the features that are accessed
through the rest of the product tab bar.
