# Attachments

An attachment is any kind of file that you want customers to be able to download
before they purchase. For instance, you might post a .pdf of a user
manual, or a video of a product demonstration.

To add an attachment to a product, click on the product in the catalog and then
go to the *Attachments* tab. Click on the *Add* button and then click *Select
File* to either upload a file or select one from the Documents and Media
repository. Set a priority if you are attaching more than one file (lower
numbers will appear first on the product page), and choose an option value from
the drop-down box if you only want to associate the attachment with one option.
To associate an attachment with more than one option, go back to the
*Attachments* tab and then add it a second time from the docs and media
repository (there's no need to upload it a second time), choosing a different
option value the second time through. If you do not select an option value, then
the attachment will be displayed for all values.

That's it for attachments. The next section covers product relations.
