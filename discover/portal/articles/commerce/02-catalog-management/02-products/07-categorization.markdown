# Categorization

Unless your catalog contains a very narrow range of merchandise, you will
probably want to categorize and tag your products to make them easier for
customers to find. 

## Categories

Categories have to exist before you can assign products to them. If you haven't
already, go to *Site Menu* &rarr; *Content* &rarr; *Categories* to create
whatever vocabularies, categories, and subcategories you want. To learn more
about the process go to the [Organizing Content with Tags and
Categories](/discover/portal/-/knowledge_base/7.1/organizing-content-with-tags-
and-categories)
section.

The names of your categories are not a matter of indifference. As you set up
your web store, you're likely to eventually use a *Commerce Category Navigation*
portlet to help your customers find what they want. This portlet uses your
category names to create a menu that directs customers exactly where they want
to go.

The names of your vocabularies will not be displayed to customers, but the
category tree will be.

Once your categories have been created, go to the catalog and click on the
product you want to categorize and then on the categorization tab. To assign to
a category, click the *Select* button under the appropriate Vocabulary title.
Then check the box next to each category that applies.

Once your products are categorized, you can easily create category display pages
to help your customers navigate to the products they want.

## Tags

Unlike categories, tags can be created the moment they are assigned to
a product. From the product categorization tab, just type in whatever tags you
want. The product will then be associated with those tags in your customers'
search results.
