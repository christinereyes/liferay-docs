# Option Categories (suggest we rename this to Specification Categories)

Specifications provide information about the product that is not customer
selectable. Creating an option category allows those specifications to be listed
together on a products page.

![Figure x: This product's specifications are all grouped into a single
category, *Details*.](../../../images/spec-category.png)

Other use cases might call for more option categories. For instance, a purveyor
of personal computers might want to have one category for hardware configuration
and another for software.

To create an option category, click on the *Option Categories* tab in *Site
Menu* &rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog*. Then click on the *Add* button and
fill in the form.

    -Title: this is the label that will appear at the start of each category. In
    the screenshot above, the title is *Details*.

    -Description: *I don't know where text entered here will appear*

    -Priority: This establishes the order in which the Option Categories will be
    listed. Smallest numbers go first.

    -Key:A programmatic identifier for this option category. This field
    auto-fills and can be safely ignored by most users.

Once the form is complete, click *Save*. The next section explains how to assign
specifications to these categories.
