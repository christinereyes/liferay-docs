## Specifications

Specifications provide information about a product that is not customer
selectable. Like options, specifications take values, but since there is no
selection to be made, a product can have only one value per specification. For
example, if a product comes in multiple colors, it would have a *Color*
**option** with several values for the customer to choose from. If product comes
in only one color, then it would deploy a *Color* **specification** with only
a single value (probably black).

To create a specification, click on the *Specifications* tab in *Site Menu*
&rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog*. Then click on the *Add* button and fill in
the form.

    -Title: This is the specification's name, not the specification itself. If
    you want to specify that a product is colored is *black*, then enter *Color*
    in this field.

    -Description: *unknown*

    -Facetable *unknown*

    -Category: See Option Categories/Specification Categories for more detail.
    Categories are optional; uncategorized specifications are displayed on the
    product page just above any categorized specs.

    -Key:A programmatic identifier for this specification. This field auto-fills
    and can be safely ignored by most users.

After filling in the appropriate fields, click save. The specification has been
created, but assigning a value to it must be done on the product level (link).
