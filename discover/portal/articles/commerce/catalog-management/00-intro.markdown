# Catalog Management

The commerce catalog is at the heart of any webstore, providing the store's core
content and organizing the metadata that will help create an engaging shopping
experience.

To populate your catalog, go to the Site Menu and click on *Commerce* &rarr;
*Catalog*. This displays the *Products* tab of the Catalog page, with additional
tabs for *Options*, *Option Categories* and *Specifications*.
