### Creating Products

Regardless of which product type you choose, you must fill out the *Add Product*
form next. The form is the same for all product types and contains the following
fields:

    -Title: the product's name. This is the only required field.

    -Short Description: 
<!--I would expect text entered here to be displayed wherever
    the product appears in a list or in thumbnail form (such as search results). 
But
    I can't find it anywhere.-->

    -Full Description: This text is visible to customers on the product page.
    The integrated text editor provides a number of formatting options that
    appear when text is selected, and clicking on the *Add* button that appears
    when the editor is in focus provides additional options. For more
    flexibility, click on the *Code View* button on the right to edit the html
    directly.

    -Friendly URL: This is the URL for the product page. It auto-fills but
    can be changed.

    -Meta Title: 
<!--Not sure what these three items are-->

    -Meta Keywords:

    -Meta Description:

    -Schedule: Products can displayed to customers for a preset window of time.
<!--The *never expire* box is self-explanatory, but I'm not sure exactly what
the published box does. If I uncheck it can still find the item and proceed to
checkout with it.-->

Once the *Add Product* form is complete to your satisfaction, click the
*Publish* button to add the product to the catalog.

The next section explains product types.
