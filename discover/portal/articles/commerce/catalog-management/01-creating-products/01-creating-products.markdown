## Products

The contents of the catalog are displayed on the *Products* tab at *Site Menu*
&rarr; *Commerce* &rarr; *Catalog*. Here you can search, sort, and filter the
catalog. You can also add products manually by clicking on the *Add* button
(![Add](../../../images/icon-add.png)) button at the bottom of the screen and
then selecting the type of product you wish to create: simple, grouped or
virtual.

Regardless of which product type you choose, you must fill out the *Add Product*
form next. The form is the same for all product types and contains the following
fields:

    -Title: the product's name. This is the only required field.

    -Short Description: *I would expect text entered here to be displayed wherever
    the product appears in a list or in thumbnail form (such as search results). But
    I can't find it anywhere.*

    -Full Description: This text is visible to customers on the main product
    page. The integrated text editor provides a number of formatting options
    that appear when text is selected, and clicking on the *Add* button that
    appears when the editor is in focus provides additional options.
