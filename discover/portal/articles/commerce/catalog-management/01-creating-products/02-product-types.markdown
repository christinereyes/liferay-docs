### Product Types

Whenever you add a product to your catalog, you must choose between the three
product types: simple, grouped and virtual. After you've filled out the *Add
Product* form and hit *Publish*, a new tab bar will appear at the top of the
screen (the tab bar can be reached again at any time by navigating to the
catalog and selecting a product). The contents of that bar depend in part on
type of product you added.

#### Simple Products

A simple product is...well...pretty simple. Just about any physical object--in
general, anything that can be bought from a brick-and-mortar store--can be
a simple product. When you create simple product, the standard product tab bar
is displayed, starting with a *Details* tab that where you can edit entries from
the *Add Product* form.

#### Grouped Products

Honestly, grouped products aren't that much more complex than simple products.
A grouped product consists of two or more simple products from the catalog,
bundled together under a single SKU.

A Grouped product has just one extra tab--*Grouped*--in its product tab bar.
From the *Grouped* tab, click on the *Add* button in the lower-right to add and
select any number of simple products. Once the simple products have been added
to the group, they can be edited individually to set a quantity and a priority
Virtual products and other grouped products cannot be added to the group.

It is not recommended that you attempt to add a grouped product to itself.

#### Virtual Products

A virtual product is any salable but non-physical item. No, we're not talking
about ripping your customers off--virtual products include extended warranties,
service contracts, digital subscriptions or almost anything else that can be
downloaded rather than shipped.

A virtual product also has an extra tab--fittingly, *Virtual*--in its product
tab bar. The *Virtual* tab contains the following fields:

    -URL/Select File: If your virtual product is stored at a web address, enter 
the
    URL here. Alternatively, click *Select* to upload a local file or select one
    that was uploaded previously.

    -Activation Status:
<!--Not sure exactly what this is*--> 

    -Duration: Enter the number of days after purchase in which customers will
    have access to the file. A value of 0 sets no limit.

    -Max Usages: Set the number of times a customer can download the file.
    A value of 0 sets no limit.

    -Sample: Upload or enter a URL for a sample file that will be available to
    prospective buyers. The *Use Sample* box must be checked before customers
    will see the sample.

    -Terms of Use: Either enter a Terms of Use document directly into the
    integrated editor, or select a document previously uploaded to Web Content.

The *Terms of Use* editor offers simple formatting options via the GUI, as well
as complete html functionality via the *Code View* button.

That's it for product types. The following sections cover the remaining items in
the product tab bar.
